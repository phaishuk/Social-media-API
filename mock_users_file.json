It may feel a bit contradictory, but by helping people do some stuff by themselves they will come to you when they need more help. Because they will trust your expertise on a topic.

You can find a restaurant in almost every IKEA store and they also sell food products that people can take home. And sustainability is becoming a serious factor in people’s considerations to buy somewhere. This post shows us that a lot of IKEA followers respond well to this focus on sustainability. What we can learn from this post is that the price or quality of your product isn’t the only thing that people care about. Of course, it’s important to tell people about that as well. But don’t be afraid to share news on your ambitions, your companies values and what you care about. People want to know who they’re buying from and whether this company fits their own values and ambitions. Especially when you’re just starting out, sharing your story and where you want to go can get people interested in your brand. Don’t shy away from a personal touch in your social posts if it fits your brand.", "created_at": "2023-06-19T11:26:47.240Z", "is_updated": false, "content": "post_content/ikea.png"}}, {"model": "social_network.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"owner": 4, "title": "OREO: Ask questions that are easy and fun to answer", "text": "We’re assuming you’re familiar with OREO, but if you’re not: it’s an American brand that mainly sells cookies. Although they’re mostly known for their classic Oreo cookie, they also offer other flavors. In a recent Instagram Story they asked their fans to choose their favorite flavor. What’s good about this type of story is that they’re easy to interact with for people that are viewing the story. They only need to tap their screen once and they directly get to see the results so far. It’s fun to see and it gives you valuable information about your audience. Plus, this kind of Instagram Story, in which you ask a question, is relatively easy to make.", "created_at": "2023-06-19T11:29:01.623Z", "is_updated": false, "content": "post_content/oreo.png"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 6, "fields": {"user": 4, "post": 3, "created_at": "2023-06-19T14:56:58.835Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 7, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 3, "created_at": "2023-06-19T14:58:22.399Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 8, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 1, "created_at": "2023-06-19T15:02:38.322Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 9, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 5, "created_at": "2023-06-19T15:02:50.212Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 10, "fields": {"user": 4, "post": 1, "created_at": "2023-06-19T15:41:11.376Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.like", "pk": 11, "fields": {"user": 4, "post": 8, "created_at": "2023-06-19T16:01:20.588Z"}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 4, "post": 5, "text": "This is very intersting!", "created_at": "2023-06-20T09:40:14.591Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 4, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 5, "text": "I`m take it to consideration", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:06:33.779Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 5, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 1, "text": "Wow, what a cool post!", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:49:21.780Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 6, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 2, "text": "Looks like a serious stuff!", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:50:06.169Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 7, "fields": {"user": 1, "post": 2, "text": "Looks like a serious stuff!", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:50:27.664Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 8, "fields": {"user": 1, "post": 4, "text": "i think that's very important to pay attantion on this stuff!", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:52:45.437Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 9, "fields": {"user": 1, "post": 7, "text": "i write write here because am borring", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:54:10.175Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 10, "fields": {"user": 4, "post": 7, "text": "why do you boring?", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:54:53.325Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 11, "fields": {"user": 1, "post": 7, "text": "because angelina jolie doesn't pay attantion on me", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:55:55.229Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 12, "fields": {"user": 6, "post": 7, "text": "petrovich, you realy want my attantion on you?", "created_at": "2023-06-20T10:58:01.182Z", "is_updated": false}}, {"model": "social_network.comment", "pk": 13, "fields": {"user": 1, "post": 7, "text": "oh my God, Angelina Jolie wrote me!
